Required: .NET 6
Optional: VS 2022

To run the application on the command line call `dotnet run` from the `/Huboo.App` folder.

The application will print the URLs to std out, e.g.:

        info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
                Now listening on: https://localhost:7216
        info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
                Now listening on: http://localhost:5203
	
        
To execute the tests on the command line call `dotnet test` from the `/Huboo.Test` folder.


Alternatively, load the entire solution into VS 2022 to:

	- run the application (F5)
	- execute the tests (Test > Test Explorer > Run All Tests In View)
